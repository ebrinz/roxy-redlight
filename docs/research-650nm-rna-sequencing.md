## Abstract

### Background
Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) impacts 60-70% of the global adult population. Earlier studies demonstrated that "hair growth is stimulated by 650-nm red light," suggesting therapeutic potential.

### Objective
This research aimed to explore the impact and molecular mechanisms of 650-nm red light on AGA using cultured hair follicle tissue.

### Methods
- Human hair follicles sourced from AGA patients undergoing hair transplants
- *Ex vivo* culture in Williams E medium
- Treatment groups: control, 5-minute light exposure, 10-minute light exposure
- Analysis tools: Real-time RT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining, RNA-sequencing

### Results

#### Hair Growth Promotion
- "Both 5 minutes and 10 minutes treatment with 650 nm red light increased the mean length of hair shaft" compared to control groups
- 5-minute treatment showed statistically significant improvement (p<0.05)
- Ki67 proliferation marker demonstrated enhanced cellular activity in light-treated follicles

#### Hair Cycle Extension
- Red light treatment postponed transition from anagen (growth) to catagen (regression) phase
- Day 8 comparison: 45.8% of treated follicles remained in anagen versus 33.3% in controls
- Catagen follicles: 54.1% (treated) versus 66.6% (control)

#### Gene Expression Findings
- **Differentially Expressed Transcripts (DETs):** 728 identified between treatment and control groups
  - 410 upregulated transcripts
  - 318 downregulated transcripts

### RNA Sequencing & Pathway Analysis

#### Key Enriched Pathways (KEGG)
The analysis revealed significant biological pathways with p-value <0.001:

1. **Leukocyte Transendothelial Migration:** Genes including JAM3, CTNND1, RAP1B, ITGB2
2. **Metabolic Pathways:** PFKM, MAT1A, PHX2, GGT5
3. **Adherens Junction:** MAP3K7, CTNNB1, FYN, CSNK2A1
4. **Amino Acid Degradation:** Valine, leucine, isoleucine degradation
5. **Lysosome Pathway**
6. **Ketone Body Synthesis and Degradation**

#### Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis
- **Molecular Function:** Intracellular protein and ATP binding
- **Biological Process:** Cell cycle regulation, androgen receptor signaling modulation
- **Cellular Components:** Intracellular protein interactions

#### Wnt Pathway Activation
Real-time PCR verification confirmed upregulation of Wnt signaling pathway components, including Wnt10b and β-catenin, which are crucial for hair follicle homeostasis.

## Discussion Insights

### Mechanisms of Action

**Anti-inflammatory Effects:** The research suggests "LLLT inhibits leukocyte migration and infiltration and may play an anti-inflammatory role in protecting HFs" through transendothelial migration pathway suppression.

**Cell Cycle Regulation:** Red light treatment promotes follicle proliferation by regulating cell cycle progression and androgen receptor signaling, countering the miniaturization characteristic of AGA.

**Metabolic Enhancement:** Increased metabolic pathway activation supports cellular energy production and biosynthesis required for sustained hair growth.

**Tissue Architecture:** Adherens junction pathway activation strengthens cell-cell contacts and tissue integrity, important for maintaining follicle structure during the growth phase.

### Clinical Significance
The findings demonstrate that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) at 650 nm:
- Extends the anagen phase duration
- Reduces spontaneous catagen transition
- Promotes cellular proliferation within the hair matrix
- Potentially reverses miniaturization in androgenetic alopecia

## Conclusions

This *ex vivo* study provides evidence that "650-nm red light promoted human hair growth and inhibited spontaneous catagen transition in ex vivo HFs." The transcriptome analysis revealed multiple activated signaling pathways—particularly leukocyte migration, metabolic, and adhesion-related pathways—supporting the therapeutic mechanism of 650 nm photobiomodulation for treating hair loss associated with androgenetic alopecia.

The research demonstrates that LLLT represents a potentially safe, non-invasive therapeutic option for patients seeking alternatives to or adjuncts with conventional pharmacological treatments like minoxidil and finasteride.
