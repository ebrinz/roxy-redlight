## Abstract

Photobiomodulation (PBM), or low-level laser therapy, was discovered over 50 years ago when Mester observed hair regrowth in mice exposed to ruby laser. The article reviews three primary alopecia types—androgenetic, areata, and chemotherapy-induced—examining PBM's mechanisms across each condition. The review summarizes devices (primarily low-powered red laser diodes), treatment parameters, animal models, clinical trials, and patient selection criteria.

## Key Sections

### Introduction & Historical Context

The phenomenon emerged from Mester's 1967 experiments investigating laser's tumor-fighting and cancer-causing potential. While those original goals weren't achieved, researchers discovered that laser-treated wounds healed faster and hair regrew more quickly in shaved regions. The term evolved from "laser biostimulation" to "low-level laser therapy," and recently to "photobiomodulation" to reflect non-laser light sources and broader biological modulation effects.

Effective wavelengths operate in red (600-700 nm) and near-infrared (760-1000+ nm) ranges, reflecting cytochrome c oxidase absorption patterns in mitochondria. "This stimulation may happen via photodissociation of inhibitory nitric oxide from the heme and copper centers" within this enzyme complex.

### Hair Follicle Biology

Hair follicles contain approximately 250,000-500,000 units on the human scalp, cycling through three phases:

- **Anagen (growth phase):** 2-6 years duration, normally 90% of follicles
- **Catagen (involution):** 1-2 weeks
- **Telogen (resting):** 5-6 weeks

Dermal papilla cells and epithelial stem cells in the bulge region regulate this cycling through growth factor signaling (fibroblast growth factor, EGF, IGF-I, TGF-β) and transcription factors like STAT3.

### Three Main Alopecia Types

#### Androgenetic Alopecia (AGA)

Involves genetic and hormonal factors, particularly the balance between testosterone and 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). FDA-approved treatments include topical minoxidil and oral finasteride (a 5α-reductase inhibitor).

#### Alopecia Areata (AA)

An autoimmune condition where T-cells attack hair follicles. Characterized by coin-shaped hair loss patches, potentially progressing to whole scalp or body involvement. "Spontaneous remission occurs in 80% of patients within 1 year," making observation a viable approach alongside topical corticosteroids.

#### Chemotherapy-Induced Alopecia (CIA)

Results from chemotherapy triggering apoptosis in rapidly dividing keratinocytes within anagen follicle bulbs, pushing follicles into dystrophic catagen phase. Scalp cooling represents the primary intervention, preserving hair in approximately 50% of treated patients.

## Mechanisms of Action

### For Androgenetic Alopecia

PBM appears to increase the fraction of follicles in anagen phase by stimulating mitochondria in bulge stem cells. The mechanism involves:

1. Activating rudimentary mitochondria in quiescent stem cells
2. Triggering mitochondrial biogenesis
3. Increasing oxygen demand, forcing stem cells to exit their hypoxic niche
4. Generating reactive oxygen species that promote differentiation

Stem cells subsequently differentiate into progenitor cells, transiently amplifying cells, and finally matrix cells that produce hair shafts.

### For Alopecia Areata

PBM's anti-inflammatory effects shift macrophage phenotypes from pro-inflammatory M1 toward anti-inflammatory M2 states. Since "the M1 phenotype is often accompanied by a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis," PBM's enhancement of mitochondrial metabolism may reverse this inflammatory environment, reducing T-cell attacks on follicles.

### For Chemotherapy-Induced Alopecia

PBM protects cells from apoptosis by upregulating anti-apoptotic proteins in mitochondria. Additionally, opsins—blue-light responsive chromophores in follicles—reduce apoptosis and extend anagen phase when exposed to 453 nm LED light at 3.2 J/cm² fluence.

## Devices and Treatment Parameters

### Device Types

Four primary categories deliver PBM to the scalp:

1. **Hand-held combs/brushes** - Teeth part hair for improved light penetration
2. **Head bands**
3. **Caps/helmets**
4. **Stationary hoods**

Most devices employ low-power (5 mW) red laser diodes at 630-660 nm wavelengths, though some incorporate LEDs or near-infrared wavelengths.

### Dosimetry

Standard protocols specify approximately 4 J/cm² fluence delivered over 10-20 minutes. A typical calculation: 5 mW/cm² power density × 800 seconds = 4000 mJ/cm² (or 4 J/cm²). Treatment frequency typically ranges from daily to every-other-day application.

### Wavelength Considerations

A study examining multiple LED wavelengths (415, 525, 660, 830 nm) on dermal papilla cells found "660 nm was the most efficient" overall, demonstrating increased expression of Wnt signaling pathway components (β-catenin, Axin2, Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt10b) and enhanced MAPK and ERK phosphorylation. However, all wavelengths showed positive effects.

## Animal Studies

**Mester's Original Work (1967):** Weekly ruby laser treatment (694 nm, 1 J pulsed, 1 cm² spot) on depilated mouse abdominal skin showed increased hair growth in black C57BL/6 mice by treatment 5-7, with diminished effects in white Balb/c mice.

**Alopecia Areata Model:** C3H/HeJ mice receiving daily 655 nm laser (20 seconds, 3×/week for 6 weeks) showed complete hair regrowth after 2 weeks, while sham controls showed none.

**Chemotherapy-Induced Alopecia Model:** Rats exposed to cyclophosphamide, etoposide, or combination chemotherapy regrew hair 5 days earlier with daily 655 nm laser treatment (1 minute, 10 days) compared to chemotherapy-alone or sham controls.

## Clinical Trials

### Androgenetic Alopecia Studies

**HairMax LaserComb (655 nm):** 110 male subjects treated 15 minutes, 3×/week for 26 weeks showed mean hair density increase of +17.3±11.9 hairs/cm² versus sham decrease of −8.9±11.7 (p<0.0001).

**Kim et al (630/660 nm LEDs + 650 nm lasers):** 40 subjects (26 men, 14 women) treated daily for 15 minutes over 24 weeks showed +17.2±12.1 hairs/cm² increase with active treatment versus −2.1±18.3 decrease in sham group (p=0.003), including significant hair thickness increases.

**Lanzafame et al:** Males showed 62.5% hair count increase (active) versus 37% (sham, p=0.003); females showed 48% increase (active) versus 11% (sham, p<0.001) using 655 nm LED/laser helmet, 25 minutes every two days for 16 weeks.

**Combination Therapy:** Esmat et al compared minoxidil 5%, PBM (iGrow helmet, 25 min, 3×/week), and combination approaches in 45 women. All proved effective, but combination therapy demonstrated benefits earlier (2 months) than monotherapies.

### Alopecia Areata Studies

Yamazaki et al tested a SuperLizer device (600-1600 nm linear polarized light) on 15 patchy hair loss patients. Treated areas showed 46.7% hair regrowth approximately 1.6 months earlier than non-irradiated control areas (p=0.003).

### Chemotherapy-Induced Alopecia

No published clinical trials identified, though studies have been proposed.

## Safety Profile

"The incidence of side effects was rare (<10%), tolerable and transient." Reported adverse effects include dry skin, irritation, pruritus, and mild headache.

---

## Patient Selection Criteria

### For Androgenetic Alopecia

- **Both sexes respond well**, though men experience stronger DHT pressure, potentially requiring lifetime treatment
- **Earlier intervention superior:** Treatment should begin at first signs of hair thinning
- **Scalp condition matters:** Completely bald (scarred) scalp cannot regenerate follicles
- **Hair density considerations:** Dark, thick hair poses light penetration barriers, though this matters less in balding regions where hair is sparse
- **Skin pigmentation:** Dark skin (Fitzpatrick IV-VI) may require longer exposure times than light skin (Fitzpatrick I-III), though clinical evidence remains limited
- **Combination potential:** Adding minoxidil or considering PRP treatment alongside PBM warrants exploration
- **Surgical enhancement:** Possible integration with hair transplantation to improve graft acceptance and accelerate donor site healing

### For Alopecia Areata

Limited investigation compared to AGA, likely reflecting AA's relative rarity versus widespread androgenetic patterns.

### For Chemotherapy-Induced Alopecia

PBM might commence several days before chemotherapy initiation to allow hair follicles time to upregulate anti-apoptotic protein defenses before chemotherapy exposure.

## Perspectives and Future Directions

Despite accumulating positive clinical evidence, PBM adoption remains contested. Contributing factors include:

- Variable study sample sizes and potential publication bias
- Requirement for prolonged treatment (months) to achieve optimal results
- Unrealistic public expectations from aggressive marketing
- Previously limited home-use device availability

Growing accessibility to home devices and LED-based systems may improve public acceptance. The author emphasizes urgent need for rigorous clinical trials specifically examining PBM in alopecia areata and chemotherapy-induced alopecia patients.
