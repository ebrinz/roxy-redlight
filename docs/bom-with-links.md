## Notes

### Base Cap Choice

We chose a **bamboo chemo cap** instead of a welding beanie because:
- Specifically designed for sensitive scalps and hair health
- Soft, breathable fabric ideal for 20-minute therapy sessions
- Feminine aesthetic with multiple color options
- 95% bamboo viscose is gentle and moisture-wicking
- Perfect alignment with the hair regrowth purpose of the device

### LED Wavelength Clarification

- **Red LEDs:** The EDGELEC diffused LEDs are 620-625nm with 120° wide viewing angle. This is within the therapeutic range and clinically proven effective for PBM.

- **NIR LEDs:** Standard 850nm LEDs have narrow angle (~20°). Add diffuser caps for better spread, or the hair itself will provide some diffusion.

### Quantity Buffers

- LEDs: Buying 100+100 gives spares for testing and mistakes
- Resistors: Kit includes 64 values with 20 of each
- Connectors: Kit includes extras for future repairs

### Alternative Sources

For potentially lower prices, also check:
- AliExpress (longer shipping)
- Digi-Key / Mouser (for specific specs)
- eBay (mixed quality)
