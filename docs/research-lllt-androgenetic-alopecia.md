## Abstract

Androgenetic alopecia affects over half the population of both sexes. Current pharmaceutical options remain limited to minoxidil and finasteride, with hair transplantation as an alternative. This review examines LLLT as a device-based therapeutic approach. Following searches of PubMed and Google Scholar using relevant keywords, fifteen highly pertinent studies were examined. Evidence demonstrates that LLLT can stimulate hair regrowth in both genders, with the most substantial randomized controlled trials showing statistically significant increases in terminal hair count. Notably, "LLLT and minoxidil had similar efficacy in hair growth and that combination therapy was even more effective." LLLT offers a non-invasive, safe option for patients failing standard treatments, though higher-level evidence from larger controlled investigations is warranted.

## Introduction

### Overview

LLLT employs low-intensity light to activate cellular processes through photobiomodulation. The therapeutic window for biological tissue operates approximately between 650–1200 nanometers, with red or near-infrared wavelengths (600–950 nm) offering maximum penetration. The FDA approved LLLT for androgenetic alopecia treatment in 2007.

The mechanism is theorized to involve:
- Stimulating anagen re-entry in telogen follicles
- Prolonging the anagen growth phase
- Accelerating proliferation in active anagen follicles
- Promoting both reparative and physiological regeneration

### Historical Context

The timeline of LLLT development in dermatology:

- **1963:** Goldman and colleagues first applied laser technology to dermatological applications
- **1967:** Mester and associates discovered laser-induced hair growth while treating tumor-bearing mice using low-intensity red and infrared light
- **2007:** FDA approval for hair loss devices
- **2011:** Extended FDA approval to female pattern hair loss

## Key Biological Concepts

### Hair Cycle Physiology

Hair follicles undergo three cyclical phases:

1. **Anagen** – rapid, active growth phase
2. **Catagen** – apoptosis-driven regression and involution
3. **Telogen** – resting phase

Critical cellular players include bulge stem cells, dermal papilla cells, and outer root sheath keratinocytes. Growth factor families regulating this cycle encompass fibroblast growth factor, EGF, hepatocyte growth factor, IGF-I, and TGF-β. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 represents the paramount transcription factor.

### Androgenetic Alopecia Pathophysiology

AGA results from genetic susceptibility combined with androgen effects, particularly dihydrotestosterone. The condition features significantly reduced proliferative activity within hair follicle epithelium, causing terminal hair miniaturization into vellus-like structures through disrupted epithelial progenitor cell activation.

## Proposed Mechanisms of Action

### Primary Cellular Mechanism

LLLT's primary photoacceptor is cytochrome c oxidase (COX) within mitochondria. The proposed cascade involves:

1. **ATP Production Enhancement** – LLLT displaces nitric oxide from COX, enabling oxygen binding and advancing respiratory chain progression, culminating in ATP synthesis

2. **Reactive Oxygen Species Modulation** – Intracellular ROS generation follows LLLT exposure

3. **Transcription Factor Induction** – Nuclear factor kappa B and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 activation enhances gene expression and protein synthesis

### Secondary Effects

- Decreased inflammation, specifically reduced prostaglandin E-2
- Enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokine production
- Increased tissue oxygenation

### Hair Follicle-Specific Actions

LLLT may directly stimulate bulge region stem cells via heat shock protein upregulation (notably HSP27). The mechanism likely combines:

- Direct outer root sheath keratinocyte and dermal papilla cell proliferation stimulation
- Paracrine growth factor release from dermal papilla cells

The ERK pathway upregulates outer root sheath keratinocyte proliferation, while Wnt/β-catenin and ERK pathways stimulate dermal papilla cells. Suggested paracrine mediators include hepatocyte growth factor, leptin, vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor 7, and various Wnt variants.

### Biphasic Dose Response

LLLT demonstrates biphasic efficacy following the Arndt–Schulz principle: small doses stimulate, moderate doses inhibit, large doses damage. Effects depend primarily on irradiance (power density; W/cm²) and illumination duration rather than total fluence (energy density; J/cm²). Optimal balance between these parameters produces stimulatory effects.

### Stem Cell Niche Hypothesis

A compelling hypothesis proposes that LLLT activates quiescent stem cell mitochondria within their hypoxic niche. Stem cells normally maintain low mitochondrial activity and anaerobic metabolism. LLLT-induced mitochondrial activation increases oxygen demand, forcing stem cells to exit the niche seeking adequate oxygen supply. This drives differentiation through progenitor and transiently amplifying cell stages, ultimately producing matrix cells and hair structures.

## Animal Studies: Summary of Findings

### Mouse Model Studies

Wikramanayake and colleagues (2012) employed the HairMax Laser Comb at 655 nm for 20 seconds daily, three times weekly for six weeks on alopecia areata-affected mice. Hair regrowth was clinically and histologically apparent in laser-treated animals, with sham-treated controls showing no improvement.

A subsequent 2013 rat model investigating chemotherapy-induced alopecia demonstrated similar positive results with identical equipment.

### Dose-Response Investigation

Shukla and colleagues examined helium–neon laser effects (632 nm) at varying fluences on testosterone-treated Swiss albino mice. The 1 J/cm² dose significantly increased anagen-phase follicles compared to controls, while the 5 J/cm² dose produced opposite effects—demonstrating the biphasic response pattern. Notably, laser-irradiated anagen follicles appeared from deeper skin layers with altered orientation, suggesting anagen phase prolongation.

## Clinical Trial Results

### Early Studies (2003–2007)

Kim and associates (2007) evaluated 24 male AGA patients using portable light sources (655 and 780 nm) for 10 minutes daily. After 14 weeks, vertex hair density increased from 137.3 to 145.1/cm² (P<0.005), with 83% patient satisfaction.

Satino and Markou (2003) studied 35 AGA patients (28 males, 7 females) using HairMax Laser Comb for 5–10 minutes every other day over six months. Temporal area improvements reached 55% in women and 74% in men; vertex area improvements reached 65% in women and 120% in men.

### Intermediate Trials (2009–2013)

Leavitt and colleagues (2009) conducted a double-blind, sham device-controlled multicenter study with 110 male participants using the device three times weekly for 15 minutes over 26 weeks. "Significantly greater increase in mean terminal hair density has been reported when compared with subjects in the sham device group."

Lanzafame and associates (2013) employed a helmet device containing 21.5 mW lasers and 30 LEDs at 655.5 nm for 25-minute sessions every other day for 16 weeks, reporting 35% hair growth increases in male AGA patients.

### Large-Scale RCT (2014)

The largest randomized controlled trial by Jimenez and colleagues examined 128 males and 141 females across multiple HairMax Laser Comb models. "Statistically significant hair regrowth by terminal hair count in all HairMaxLaserComb® devices tested, compared with sham controls, in both males and females" was demonstrated. Improvements were independent of age, sex, and device model.

### Female Pattern Hair Loss Studies

Kim and colleagues (2013) conducted a 24-week randomized double-blind trial with both sexes using a helmet combining 650 nm laser with 630 and 660 nm LEDs. While mean hair thickness and density increased significantly in treatment groups, blinded global image assessments showed no prominent differences.

Esmat and colleagues (2017) compared LLLT against minoxidil 5% and combination therapy in 45 female AGA patients over four months. Combination therapy ranked highest for Ludwig classification improvement and patient satisfaction. Ultrasound biomicroscopy and dermoscopic findings showed significant follicle density increases in all groups at four months, with combination therapy showing earlier benefits at two months.

## Evidence Level and Guidelines

### S3 Guideline Classification

The European Dermatology Forum established evidence-based recommendations:

For males: Two studies met inclusion criteria with evidence grades A2 and C, yielding level 2 evidence.

For females: Two studies with grades A2 and C also resulted in level 2 evidence.

Overall: Three LLLT studies demonstrated increased hair count over 16–26 weeks with different protocols and devices, though no long-term follow-up data existed.

### Meta-Analytical Evidence

Adil and Godwin (2016) conducted meta-analysis across five treatment categories including LLLT in men, minoxidil formulations, finasteride, and minoxidil in women. All treatments proved superior to placebo (P<0.00001). The analysis "strongly suggest[ed] that minoxidil, finasteride, and low-level laser light therapy are effective for promoting hair growth in men with AGA and that minoxidil is effective in women with AGA."

### Current Recommendations

European evidence-based S3 guidelines suggest using "LLLT as ancillary therapy for AGA with devices that use energy levels shown to be effective in randomized controlled clinical trials." However, "S3 guidelines cannot make a recommendation for or against treatment for more than 6 months with LLLT for AGA at the present time" due to insufficient long-term data.

## Safety Profile

### Adverse Effects

LLLT demonstrates "remarkably low incidence of adverse effects when it has been used over 50 years for diverse medical conditions." Regarding hair growth applications specifically, the only reported adverse event involved temporary telogen effluvium onset during the first 1–2 months of LaserComb use, which resolved with continued application.

### Potential Considerations

Practitioners should be aware that dysplastic or malignant scalp lesions could theoretically be stimulated by LLLT's proliferative effects, though this remains theoretical rather than documented.

---

## Combination Therapy Potential

The Esmat study provided important evidence for synergistic effects. Combining LLLT with topical minoxidil 5% and oral finasteride may enhance outcomes beyond monotherapy. The study demonstrated that "combination group (iii) occupied the top position regarding Ludwig classification and patient satisfaction." This suggests multimodal approaches warrant investigation.

---

## Discussion

### Clinical Efficacy Summary

Over half of examined studies demonstrated hair regrowth improvement through increased count, density, tensile strength, and reduced shedding. Newer, larger trials with superior design showed greater validity than earlier small studies lacking appropriate controls. All investigations confirmed that repeated LLLT courses improved AGA progressively.

### Patient Selection

Evidence suggests optimal responses occur in:
- Male AGA (Hamilton–Norwood stages III–IV)
- Female AGA (Ludwig stages I–II)

This likely reflects the balance requirement between sufficient existing hair for effective photobiostimulation without excessive light absorption preventing scalp penetration.

### Comparison with Established Therapies

One significant finding was that "LLLT and minoxidil had similar efficacy in hair growth and that combination therapy was even more effective." This positioning LLLT as potentially equivalent to conventional pharmacotherapy when used alone and potentially superior when combined.

### Post-Transplant Applications

Given documented LLLT benefits on wound healing and tissue regeneration, application during immediate post-hair transplant periods may reduce healing time and enhance graft survival and early growth, though controlled studies remain lacking.

---

## Conclusion

LLLT represents "a non-invasive, safe, and potentially effective treatment option for patients with AGA who do not respond or are not tolerant to standard treatment." Combination approaches pairing LLLT with topical minoxidil and oral finasteride appear to "act synergistic to enhance hair regrowth."

However, significant evidence gaps persist. While safety is well-established, efficacy evidence remains at intermediate levels. "Due to the known beneficial effect on wound healing, LLLT as an adjunctive therapy in hair transplant surgery may also reduce post-operative healing time and increase graft survival." Nevertheless, higher-powered, longer-duration controlled investigations with larger patient populations are essential for definitively establishing LLLT's role in comprehensive AGA management.
